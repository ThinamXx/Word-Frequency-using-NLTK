# **Word Frequency using NLTK**

**Target and Objective**
- What are the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick, and how often do they occur?
  
  - In this notebook, I'll scrape the novel Moby Dick from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package requests. Then I'll extract words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. Finally, I'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK).
