# **Word Frequency using NLTK**

In this notebook, I'll scrape the novel Moby Dick from the website [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package requests. Then I'll extract words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. Finally, I'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK).

**Targets and Objectives**
- What are the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick, and how often do they occur?

**Processing and Preparing the Model**
- In this Project, I have gone through multiple Text Processing steps as noted below. You will gain insights about the implementation of NLTK in Text processing.
  - Getting Text from HTML using Beautiful Soup
  - Creating Tokenizer
  - Removing Stopwords
  - Plotting the Frequency Distribution Plot
  
**Snapshot of the Plot**
- The most common word used in Moby Dick novel is "whale" as shown by the Frequency Distribution plot.
